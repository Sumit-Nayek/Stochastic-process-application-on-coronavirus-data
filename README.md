# ðŸ“Š Stochastic Process Application on Coronavirus Data

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores the **application of stochastic processes** to model and analyze the spread of **COVID-19**.  
By applying statistical and probabilistic techniques, we attempt to capture the **uncertainty, randomness, and variability** inherent in coronavirus infection data.  

The study focuses on how stochastic modeling can provide deeper insights into the **transmission patterns, future predictions, and risk assessment** of the pandemic.

## ðŸŽ¯ Importance of the Work
- COVID-19 data is highly uncertain and influenced by multiple random factors.  
- **Stochastic processes** help to:  
  - Model **random fluctuations** in case numbers.  
  - Predict **infection trends** under uncertainty.  
  - Support **decision-making** for healthcare systems and policymakers.  
- Such models complement traditional deterministic models (like SIR), offering **realistic and flexible forecasting**.

## ðŸ§© Methods Used
- **Markov Chains**  
- **Poisson Processes**  
- **Random Variables & Probability Distributions**  
- **Simulation of Infection Spread**
